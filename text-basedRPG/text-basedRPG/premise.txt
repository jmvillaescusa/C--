Welcome to my Text-based RPG!

========================================================================
Premise & Objective

You are locked inside a small keep, unarmed, surrounded by guards and their dogs!
There is a door on the otherside of the keep, presumably the exit of this place.
But it's locked, so a key must be with one of the guards.

Your objective is to navigate, fight and find a way out of this place.
Encounters of enemies will be random as you move through the keep.
Fighting is turn-based, who ever has the higher speed will go first.
Use the armor and the sword to better your chances of escaping.
The game will end if you either escape the keep, or you're slain in battle.

To start off, what is your name? (enter your name then press ENTER to continue)
